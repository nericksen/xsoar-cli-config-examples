# XSOAR CLI Config Examples
This repository contains examples of integration configs
needed when running the `load` command of the xsoar-cli project.

These configs can be used to prepopulate free services and feeds into an 
XSOAR instance during provisioning and testing

The contents of the `examples` directory in this repository can be copied
into the `saved` directory of the XSOAR CLI.  

See [here](https://github.com/nericksen/xsoar-cli) for more details.
